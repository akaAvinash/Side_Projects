Device Flashing Script

Overview
This Python script is designed to automate the process of flashing Android devices using both ADB and Fastboot modes. It can detect connected devices, separate them into ADB and Fastboot modes, and flash custom images or files onto them. This README provides detailed instructions on how to use the script and what you need to set up before running it.

Prerequisites
Before you can use this script, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed and set up on your system:

```
Android Debug Bridge (ADB): You must have ADB installed and added to your system's PATH. ADB is used for device detection, communication, and file transfer.
Fastboot: Fastboot is used for flashing devices that are in Fastboot mode.
Python 3: This script is written in Python 3, so make sure you have Python 3 installed.
```


Connect Your Android Devices: Ensure that your Android devices are connected to your computer via USB.

Run the Script:

Copy code
```
python3 Multi_Flash_1.5.py

```

This will execute the main script, which will perform the following actions:

```
Detect connected devices.
Separate devices into ADB and Fastboot modes.
Flash ADB devices automatically.
Monitor the Process: During the script's execution, it will open multiple terminal windows (using gnome-terminal) to execute commands in parallel. Follow the prompts in these terminal windows to complete the flashing process.

Wait for Completion: The script will continue until all devices are flashed. Press Enter when the flashing process is complete.

Reassign DSN (Device Serial Number) to ADB Devices: After flashing, the script will attempt to reassign DSN to ADB devices. If any devices are not in ADB mode, they will be rebooted to get back into ADB mode.
```
Additional Notes
The flashimage.py script is used to flash images onto the devices. Ensure that it is present in the same directory as the main script.
The apps directory is pushed to ADB and Fastboot devices. Make sure that the necessary files or apps you want to push are placed inside this directory.
The script uses gnome-terminal to open multiple terminal windows. Make sure you have it installed on your system. If you are using a different terminal emulator, you may need to modify the script accordingly.
